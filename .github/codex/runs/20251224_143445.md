## SPEC.md items addressed
- Loop range drag should snap to nearest beat on release.

## Hypotheses considered
- Beat snapping should apply to loop window drag (range) while keeping handle adjustments free for fine tuning.

## Evidence
- Local lint/typecheck/test/build completed without errors (see Tests).

## Changes made
- `app/video/[id].tsx`: add beat snapping for loop window drag release; stabilize callbacks for lint.

## Tests run
- `pnpm install` (ok)
- `pnpm lint` (ok after fixing hook deps)
- `pnpm typecheck` (ok)
- `pnpm test` (ok)
- `pnpm build` (ok)

## Remaining open questions
- Whether playhead scrubbing should also snap to beats remains open.
- Need to confirm timeline touch areas feel consistent with "tap/drag to seek" requirement.
