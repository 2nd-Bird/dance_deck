- Timestamp (UTC): 2025-12-24 12:14:53 UTC
- Branch: feature/spec-convergence-2
- Loop: 1

## SPEC items addressed
- Video Detail UI: hide non-overlay controls in normal state
- Loop length selection: align preset loop start to beat grid
- Timeline interaction: allow playhead scrubbing across full track height

## Hypotheses considered
- Persistent playback controls violate "UI hidden until tap" requirement
- Manual loop handle drags should stay unsnapped per "snap解除" guidance

## Evidence
- Code inspection in app/video/[id].tsx

## Changes made
- Remove persistent mirror/speed controls from video view
- Snap loop length presets to phase-aligned beat grid
- Expand playhead scrub target to entire timeline track

## Tests run
- pnpm install (ok; warning: ignored build scripts for unrs-resolver)
- pnpm lint (ok)
- pnpm typecheck (ok)
- pnpm test (ok)
- pnpm build (ok; expo-av deprecation warning)

## Remaining open questions
- Confirm playhead vs loop touch separation feels correct on device
- Confirm beat snap behavior matches expected loop-start feel after presets
