- Branch: feature/spec-convergence-1
- Loop: 1
- SPEC items addressed:
  - Video Surface double-tap skip with +5s/-5s feedback ripple and label
  - Overlay controls auto-fade behavior during playback
  - Persistent Mirror/Speed controls visibility outside overlay
  - Loop Length selection animation polish
  - Progress bar hit area padding for easier scrubbing
  - Loop window drag snaps to beat on release (range drag)
- Hypotheses considered:
  - Overlay auto-hide should not collapse loop/timeline edit mode
- Evidence:
  - Updated Video Detail screen handlers and styles
  - Manual UI logic review (no runtime logs requested)
- Changes made:
  - app/video/[id].tsx: added double-tap detection, skip feedback, overlay auto-fade, persistent controls, layout animation for loop length, padded seek hit area, and beat snap on range drag release
- Tests run:
  - pnpm install
  - pnpm lint
  - pnpm typecheck
  - pnpm test
  - pnpm build
- Results:
  - All commands succeeded
- Remaining open questions:
  - Confirm Expo Go interaction feel (double tap skip + overlay fade timing)
