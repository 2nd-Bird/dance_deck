# Dance Deck

Local-video practice library for dancers with beat-synced loop tooling.

iOS Expo Go manual check: run `pnpm start` and open the Expo Go client on the same network, tap the + button on Home to pick a local video from the media library, confirm the picker log prints asset details in the Metro console, and verify the newly imported tile appears immediately with a thumbnail or placeholder and can be opened from the grid.
